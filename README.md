# Optimization-Techniques

This repository contains MATLAB codes for various optimization techniques commonly used in linear programming problems (LPP). Below is a brief overview of the techniques covered:

## File Structure:

- `lab1.m`: MATLAB script to solve LPP using the graphical method.
- `lab2_main.m`: MATLAB script to solve bounded linear programming problems.
- `lab2_constraint.m`: MATLAB user defined function to calculate contraints given in lab2_main.m.
- `lab3.m`: MATLAB code for solving LPP using the algebraic method.
- `lab4.m`: MATLAB script implementing the simplex method for solving LPP.
- `lab5.m` : MATLAB script for big-m method.

## How to Use

Each directory contains MATLAB scripts or functions for the respective optimization technique. To use the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired technique directory.
3. Open the MATLAB script or function in MATLAB or any compatible IDE.
4. Modify the input parameters as needed and execute the code.
