# Optimization-Techniques

This repository contains MATLAB codes for various optimization techniques commonly used in linear programming problems (LPP). Below is a brief overview of the techniques covered:

## File Structure:

- `lab1.m`: MATLAB script to solve LPP using the graphical method.
- `lab2_main.m`: MATLAB script to solve bounded linear programming problems.
- `lab2_constraint.m`: MATLAB user defined function to calculate contraints given in lab2_main.m.
- `lab3_algebraic.m`: MATLAB code for solving LPP using the algebraic method.
- `lab4_simplex.m`: MATLAB script implementing the simplex method for solving LPP.
- `lab5_bigM.m` : MATLAB script for big-m method.
- `lab6_twoPhase.m` : MATLAB script for two phase method.
- `lab7_tp_lcm.m` : MATLAB script for transport problem using least cost matrix (North-West Method).
- `lab8_steepest_descent.m` : MATLAB script for steepest descent using alpha.

## How to Use

Each directory contains MATLAB scripts or functions for the respective optimization technique. To use the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired technique directory.
